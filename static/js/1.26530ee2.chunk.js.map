There may be some restrictions on where you can send payments\r\n      in certain local currencies.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      We may allow you to choose the way in which your account treats and/or\r\n      converts payments received in local currencies other than the opening\r\n      currency of your account. To receive transfer in a currency other than the\r\n      opening currency of your account, it may be necessary to create a balance\r\n      in that currency or convert the transfer into another currency that we\r\n      allow you to hold.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      Payments in certain local currencies can only be received by automatic\r\n      conversion of the transfer into another currency that we allow you to\r\n      hold.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of local currency\r\n      you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform. You may not\r\n      manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion\r\n      arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that we determine is\r\n      primarily for the purpose of gaining or making profit based on currency\r\n      conversion rates. We may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we\r\n      determine to violate this policy.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
